<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Guided Tissue Regeneration Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Membrane</li><li>Non-absorbable Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Dental Guided Tissue Regeneration Membrane market is divided into two main types: absorbable membranes and non-absorbable membranes. Absorbable membranes, made from materials that can be naturally broken down by the body, eliminate the need for a second surgical procedure for removal. Non-absorbable membranes, on the other hand, require surgical removal after they have served their purpose in supporting tissue regeneration. Both types play crucial roles in dental surgeries, promoting healing and effective regeneration of periodontal tissues.</p></p>
