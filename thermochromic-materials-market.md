<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermochromic Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversible Thermochromic Materials</li><li>Irreversible Thermochromic Materials</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thermochromic materials market is divided into two main types: reversible and irreversible thermochromic materials. Reversible thermochromic materials change color in response to temperature fluctuations and revert to their original hue once the temperature stabilizes, making them ideal for applications like mood rings and temperature-sensitive packaging. Conversely, irreversible thermochromic materials undergo a permanent color change when exposed to heat, often used for safety indicators and temperature monitoring, ensuring a clear and lasting signal of temperature exposure.</p></p>
