<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Heating Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-condensing Boilers</li><li>Condensing Boilers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The residential heating boilers market features two primary types: non-condensing and condensing boilers. Non-condensing boilers operate at lower efficiencies, expelling flue gases without extracting heat, making them less energy-efficient. In contrast, condensing boilers are designed to maximize efficiency by capturing and reusing heat from exhaust gases, resulting in lower energy consumption and emissions. While non-condensing boilers are generally less costly upfront, condensing boilers offer long-term savings and environmental benefits, driving their growing popularity in modern heating solutions.</p></p>
