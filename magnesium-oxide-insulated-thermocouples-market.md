<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnesium Oxide Insulated Thermocouples Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grounded Type</li><li>Ungrounded Type</li><li>Exposed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Magnesium Oxide Insulated Thermocouples are classified into three main types based on their construction and insulation capabilities. Grounded Type thermocouples have a direct electrical connection to the sensing element, allowing for rapid response but increased risk of ground loops. Ungrounded Type models feature insulation between the sensing element and the sheath, providing electrical isolation and slower response times. Exposed Type thermocouples have no protective sheath, allowing for immediate temperature readings but leaving them susceptible to damage in harsh environments.</p></p>
