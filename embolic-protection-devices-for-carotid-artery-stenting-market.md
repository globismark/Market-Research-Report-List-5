<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Embolic Protection Devices for Carotid Artery Stenting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Distal Occlusion Devices</li><li>Proximal Occlusion Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Embolic protection devices for carotid artery stenting are vital in preventing embolic events during the procedure. Distal occlusion devices are positioned downstream from the intervention site, capturing debris before it can reach the brain, thereby minimizing the risk of stroke. Conversely, proximal occlusion devices are placed upstream to block blood flow and protect the cerebral circulation during stenting. Both device types enhance patient safety by effectively managing potential embolic material released during carotid artery interventions.</p></p>
