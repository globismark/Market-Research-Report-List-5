<p><strong>The Hybrid System in Automotive Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mild Hybrid</li><li>HEV</li><li>PHEV</li><li>EV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hybrid systems in the automotive market combine traditional combustion engines with electric motors to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. Mild hybrid vehicles have a smaller electric motor that assists the engine during acceleration. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) use electric motors for low-speed driving and switch to the combustion engine at higher speeds. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) can be charged from an external power source, allowing for extended electric-only driving. Electric vehicles (EVs) run solely on electric power, using no gasoline.</p></p>
