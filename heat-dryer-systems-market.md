<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Dryer Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Type</li><li>Indirect Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heat dryer systems are available in two main types - direct type and indirect type. Direct type heat dryers directly expose the material to hot air or gas for drying, achieving faster drying times. On the other hand, indirect type heat dryers use a heat exchanger to transfer heat to the material, making it suitable for delicate materials or where direct contact with hot air is not desired. Both types of heat dryer systems have their own advantages and are used in various industries for drying different types of materials.</p></p>
